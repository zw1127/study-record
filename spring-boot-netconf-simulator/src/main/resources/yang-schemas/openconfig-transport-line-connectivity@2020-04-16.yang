    "This model describes the device-level connectivity
     (e.g., internal port-to-port) for optical transport line
     system elements such as wavelength routers (ROADMs) and
     amplifiers. All connections are uni-directional. Note that
     this model explicitly does not intend to model or provide
     a path to any higher layer topology modeling and is only
     for modeling internal links";
